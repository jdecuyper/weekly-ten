The Weekly Programming Challenge : http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2016/10/1/weekly-programming-challenge-10.html

** Installation

Requires Leiningen to build:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
lein uberjasr
#+END_SRC

** Usage

To start the server:

#+BEGIN_SRC 
$ java -jar target/uberjar/weekly-ten-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar --server <port>
#+END_SRC

To launch a client that will send a query to the server:

#+BEGIN_SRC 
$ java -jar target/uberjar/weekly-ten-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar --client <host> <port> <query>
#+END_SRC

The query engine is really simple - it simply returns the ~query~ reversed.

** Design

The server is built in a way that allows a custom 'handler' to be defined. When launching from the command-line the ~simple-protocol-handler~ is used.

The ~simple-protocol-handler~ defines the protocol described in the challenge.

The server can be started in embedded mode like so:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(weekly-ten.server/start-server handler-function port)
#+END_SRC

where the ~handler-function~ is a function that takes two parameters: a ~java.io.InputStream~ (for reading from the client) and a ~java.io.OutputStream~ (for writing to the client). The accepting connections, managing resources etc. is handled outside of this.

So - in theory - implementing the HTTP server should be possible by simple adding another "handler function".

*** Bugs

Most likely.
